If a comment is held for moderation an email message is sent to the comment author with a link to verify the comment author's email address.

== Description ==

If a comment is held for moderation an email message is sent to the comment author with a link to verify the comment author's email address. When the comment author clicks on that link the comment gets approved immediately. This makes discussions more lively as users don't have to wait for the blog admin to approve the comment.

Blog owners may also choose to hold the comments in the moderation queue even after successful verification. The verification status is shown in the comment lists in the admin.

If an author has a previously approved comment and his comments gets approved automatically according to the 'comment_whitelist' option in WordPress no email is sent.

If a comment is classified as spam by Akismet or another anti-spam plugin no email is sent.

This plugin uses the `commentmeta` table and thus requires WordPress 2.9

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `comment-email-verify` folder to the `wp-content/plugins` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to <em>Settings</em> -> <em>Comment E-Mail Verification</em> to customize the email message that is sent to comment authors. You may use a number of <a href="http://ten-fingers-and-a-brain.com/wordpress-plugins/comment-email-verify/shortcodes/">shortcodes</a>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin work with versions of WordPress older than 2.9? =

Absolutely not. This plugin uses the `commentmeta` table new to WordPress 2.9

= I don't get notified when a comment is held for moderation. =

This plugin doesn't notify you. It sends mail to the comment author.

= When I test this using my Yahoo/Gmail/Hotmail/xyz address I don't receive a verification message. It's not even in my spam folder. =

You should try configuring the plugin to use SMTP!

If you have already done so, please check your settings!

If it's only Yahoo/Gmail/Hotmail/xyz users who don't receive your messages, but it works well for others, then it might be that your host has a bad reputation and is blacklisted. (I've seen that happen so many times. Notice the "might".)

== Screenshots ==

1. Customize the email message that is sent to comment authors
2. Comment authors will see a hint after posting their comment (theme must be compatible)
